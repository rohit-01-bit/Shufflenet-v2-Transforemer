We are attaching three datasets links in dataset link option. THree interactive python notebooks where the model is trained, tested, and result analysis is done.

Three python note books are attached as shown below:

1.casiav1
2.defactosplicing
3.MICC-f2000

The proposed code is for Shufflenet-v2 + Transformer model.

It contains three types of blocks:
1.Shufflenet v2 block
2.Shufflenet unit block
3.Transformer block

The platform to be used for running this codes is:
1. Google colab
2. Kaggle
3. Local Jupyter notebook

Frame work used for designing this model:
1. Tensorflow
